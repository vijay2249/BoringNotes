# Virtual Machines

### Intro

These are ==separate machines== in your host machines. These machines use the hardware of host system but the software is virtualized. Hence if there is any problem while playing with the virtual machine it wont effect the host machine

Common frameworks for using these are [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) by Oracle and [VM Ware](https://www.vmware.com/)

### Characteristics

#### Pros

> * Separated Environments
> * Environment specific configurations are possible
> * Environment configurations can be shared and reproduced reliably

#### Cons

> * Redundant duplication
> * Waste of space
> * Performance can be slow, boot times can be long
> * Reproducing on another computer/server is possible but may be still be tricky due to the fact that all configurations must be same and must be valid for all operating systems

_There is no single configuration file that we can share our vm for multiple operating systems_
