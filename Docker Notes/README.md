## What are [[Containers]]

> Why would we want *independent*, *standardized*, **"application packages"** ?

	1. We want to have the exact same environment for development and production
		a. This ensures that it works exactly as tested
	2. It should be easy to share a common development environment setup with teammates
	3. When switching between projects, tools used in one project should not clash with tools used in another project
	4. We dont want to uninstall and re-install local dependencies and do setup and runtime all the time


Compared to [[Virtual Machines]], Docker is simpler to use/share/deploy also it takes less storage relatively to fire up the resources to deploy the application

_Now lets get into what are docker [[Images and containers]]_
