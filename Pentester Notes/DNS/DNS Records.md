DNS records aka zone files are instructions that live in authoritative DNS servers and provide information about a domain including what IP address is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain

These records consists of a series of text files written in what is known as DNS syntax. It is just a string of characters used as commands that tell the DNS server what to do. All DNS records also have a TTL, which stands for Time To Live, and indicates how often a DNS server will refresh that record.


### Most common types of _DNS records_

- __A record__
	- the record that holds the IP address of domain
- __AAAA record__
	- the record that contains IPv6 address for a domain, as opposed to A records which list the IPv4 address
- __CNAME record__
	- forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain, does NOT provide an IP address
- __MX record__
	- directs mail to an email server
- __TXT record__
	- lets an admin store text nodes in the record, these records are often used for email security
- __NS record__
	- stores the name server for a DNS entry
- __SOA record__
	- stores admin information about a domain
- __SRV record__
	- specifies a port for specific services
- __PTR record__
	- provides a domain name in reverse-lookups


### Less commonly used _DNS records_
- __AFSDB record__ - used for clients of Andrew File System developer by Carnegie Melon. this record functions to find other AFS cells
- __APL record__ - the 'address prefix list' is an experimental record that specifies lists of address ranges
- __CAA record__ - this is the 'certification authority authorization' record, it allows domain owners state which certificate authorities can issue certificates for that domain. If no CAA record exists, then anyone can issue a certificate for that domain. These records are also inherited by subdomains.
- __DNSKEY record__ - it contains a public key used to verify DNSSEC signatures.
- __CDNSKEY record__ - this is a child copy of DNSSEC record, meant to be transferred to a parent.
- __CERT record__ - the 'certificate record' stores the public key certificates
- __DCHID record__ - the DHCP identifier stores info about the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and standardized network protocol used on IP networks.
- __DNAME record__ - the delegation name record creates a domain alias, just like CNAME, but this alias will redirect all subdomains as well. For instance if the owner of 'example.com' bought the domain 'website.net' and gave it a DNAME record that points to 'example.com', then that pointer would also extend to 'blog.website.net' and any other subdomains.
- __HIP record__ - this record uses Host Identity Protocol, a way to separate the roles of an IP address, this record is used most often in mobile computing
- __IPSECKEY record__ - this record works with the Internet Protocol Security, and end-to-end security protocol framework and part of IP suite
- __LOC record__ - the location record contains geographical information for a domain in the form of longitude and latitude coordinates
- __NAPTR record__ - the name authority pointer record can be combined with SRV record to dynamically create URIs to point based on a regular expression
- __RRSIG record__ - the resource record signature is a record to store digital signatures used to authenticate record in accordance with DNSSEC
- __RP record__ - this is the responsible person record and it stores the email address of the person responsible for that domain
- __SSHFP record__ - this record stores the SSH public key fingerprints,
