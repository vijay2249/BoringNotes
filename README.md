Just sharing my knowledge... Wanna contribute? Please do it. Anything and all knowledge is to share and learn.

 I am writing my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app, so somefiles will be emtpy for now and also there is different syntax for file linking using obsidian, hence you will frequently see double square brackets in the files that simply means that there is link between this current file and the filename mentioned inside that double square brackets.


See Contributing.MD file for more info.

## Update
All folders are required to have a _summary.md_ file that should display the order in which user must go through the concepts which is better than to just go through files on by one randomly.

If there is no such _summary.md_ file found then any pr will not be accepted.

For now directly commiting to main branch is dismissed due to this specific reason.

Once the main branch is updated with the required workings, all the settings will be reverted back.
