What are Arrays represented as behind the scenes in [[JavaScript/Index.docs|JS]]?

Well basically arrays are Objects in the end.
Hence
```javascript
[1,2,3] === [1,2,3] //returns false , since the object address is compared and they are different in this particular case even though the elements inside both arrays are same.
```
