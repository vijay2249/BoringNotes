## Azure Portal


## Azure Cloud Shell
- is temporary and requires a new or existing azure files share to be mounted
- authentication is done automatically
- runs on a temporary host provided on a per-session, per-user basis
- requires resource group, storage account, azure file share


## Azure PowerShell

is available in two ways: inside a browser via the Azure cloud shell, or with a local installation on linux, macos, windows os



## Azure CLI
it provides cross-platform command line tools for managing azure resources.

Commands in the CLI are structured in _groups_ and _subgroups_. Each group represents a service provided by azure and the subgroups divide the commands for these services into logical groupings.<br>
`storage` group comtains subgroups including `account`, `blob`, `share`, `queue`
